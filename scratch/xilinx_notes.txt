1. It's very hard to install Xilinx's Vivado toolchain on a headless server.
Hence, to install it on EC2, you need to install x11-related packages on EC2,
and then use X forwarding over SSH to run the Vivado installer. This seems to
work OK, although it takes a few hours.

2. The EC2 instance needs sufficient CPU, RAM, and disk to run and store the
Vivado toolchain.  For CPU and RAM, a c4.xlarge  EC2 instance should suffice.
But it doesn't have enough disk capacity by default. So you need to resize the
disk
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-modify-volume.html). A
60 GB disk should be sufficient I think. However, EC2 doesn't allow you to
resize more than once every 6 hours.

3. It is possible to run Vivado without the GUI though in "batch" mode. A quick
reference on Vivado is available here:
