Language constructs
1. arrays
2. if-else

Auto-generate
1. Clocking logic.
2. Constraints file.
3. sequential and combinational logic in always_ff and always_comb blocks respectively.
4. Top file for running specific modules on an FPGA.

Speed up:
1. Syntax checking.
2. Design space exploration.
3. Type checking.
4. Synthesis.
5. Out-of-context synthesis.

Other support:
1. Assertions.
2. printfs.
3. I/O simulations.

Testing:
1. Check correspondence with a previous version.
2. Formal, fuzzy, or approximate checks.

In general,
reduce boilerplate, return syntax errors quickly, allow quick DSE, iterate on different splits quickly, and don't make the user wait.
