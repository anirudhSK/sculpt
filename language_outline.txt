1. Snippets: input, output, and code that transforms input to output
2. Datapath: connection between the snippets

Snippets:
================
Syntax:
function_name(inputs) {
 ...
 ...
}

Datapath:
================
Syntax:
(a, b)
(b, c)
(c, d)

Output of the simulation:
================
1. Verilog code for the datapath.
2. Simulator for the datapath.

Question:
================
How do we seamlessly express refinements in this world?
